# Extra

The file extra_dl_paranoid.zip contains dependencies to make people download:
- The new blue screen overlay
- A texture for the "All items" mode, that gets added on top of the "2 spawns" box (a mode that was replaced in the stripper)
- A vmt that was not packed in the map and that sometimes cause console error spam
